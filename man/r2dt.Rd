\title{R Squared Difference Test (R2DT). Test for a statistically significant difference in genealized explained variance between two candidate models.}
\usage{
r2dt(x, y, cor = FALSE, fancy = FALSE, onesided = TRUE, clim = 95,
  nsims = 1000)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An R2 object from the r2beta function.}

\item{y}{An R2 object from the r2beta function.}

\item{cor}{if TRUE, the R squared statistics are assumed to be positively correlated and a simulation based approach is used. If FALSE, the R squared are assumed independent and the difference of independent beta distributions is used.}

\item{fancy}{if TRUE, the output values are rounded and changed to characters.}

\item{onesided}{if TRUE, the alternative hypothesis is that one model explains a larger proportion of generalized variance. If false, the alternative is that the amount of generalized variance explained by the two candidate models is not equal.}

\item{clim}{Desired confidence level for interval estimates regarding the difference in generalized explained variance.}

\item{nsims}{number of samples to draw when simulating correlated non-central beta random variables. This parameter is only relevant if cor=TRUE.}
}
\value{
A confidence interval for the difference in R Squared statistics and a p-value corresponding to the null hypothesis of no difference.
